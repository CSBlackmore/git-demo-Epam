The poet and the muse
in Alan Wake video game

Verse 1
There's an old town wrought with mystery of
Tom The Poet and his Muse
And the magic lake which gave a life
To the words the Poet used

Now the Muse, she was his happiness
And he rhymed about her grace
And told her stories of treasures
Deep beneath the blackened waves

'Till in the stillness of one dawn
Still in its mystic crown
The Muse, she went down to the lake
And in the waves she drowned
